# Switch level Modelling of CMOS Gates and Boolean Logic

The projects models standard CMOS gates and boolean logic using Verilog HDL.
Although HDL usually works at a higher level of abstraction, like registers, dataflow and control, modelling transistor level designs have some advantages:
-  switch-level modeling represents circuits at the transistor level, which theoretically allows for more precise control and potentially more efficient implementations.
- Learning and Understanding of CMOS circuits
- Build custom digital circuits in rare cases, where standard cells may not be available
- Analyze and simulate designs at the transistor level for power and timing

However, this is not widely used due many reasons:
- With switch-level design, we're directly dealing with transistors, so Process technology variations have a more immediate impact on our circuit behavior. Gate-level abstractions, by comparison, provide standard cells that have already been characterized across these variations, making designs more robust.
- Transistor sizing can be an issue as standard verilog doesn't support it, but verilog-A or verilog-AMS can.
- Increased design and verification complexity
- Tool support is limited for switch level synthesis as most commercial EDA tools are optimized for gate-level synthesis, with comprehensive libraries and optimization algorithms.

## Tools Used

1. Icarus Verilog
    Icarus Verilog (often shortened to Icarus) is a popular, open-source, command-line based Verilog simulator. It's a crucial tool in the world of digital hardware design and verification, especially within open-source and educational settings.
    - Compiles your Verilog code to create an internal representation of your design.
    - Simulates the design using an event-driven engine, processing events (signal changes) in time order.
    - Propagates value changes through the circuit's interconnections.
    - Executes procedural blocks and system tasks.
    - Allows external tools like Cocotb to interact with the simulation through interfaces, enabling powerful verification capabilities.

4. GTKWave
    GTKWave is a powerful waveform viewer used extensively in digital design and electronic design automation (EDA). It's primarily used to visualize signal waveforms generated during simulations of digital circuits and systems described in Hardware Description Languages (HDLs) like Verilog and VHDL.

    - Waveform Viewer: GTKWave's primary purpose is to display and analyze signal waveforms. These waveforms represent how signal values (logic levels, analog voltages, etc.) change over time during a simulation.
    - Post-Simulation Analysis Tool: GTKWave is a post-simulation tool. This means it doesn't perform the simulation itself. Instead, it reads waveform data that has been generated by an HDL simulator (like Icarus Verilog, ModelSim, Vivado Simulator, etc.) after a simulation run is complete.
    - Open Source and Free: GTKWave is open-source software, licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). This makes it freely available to use and distribute, a significant advantage for many users, especially in open-source and educational environments.
    - Cross-Platform: GTKWave is designed to be cross-platform and runs on various operating systems, including Linux, macOS, and Windows. This portability is essential for users working on different development platforms.
    - Graphical User Interface (GUI): GTKWave has a graphical user interface, allowing users to interact with waveforms visually.


## Build Process

```bash
make all     # Performs the entire process (compilation, simulation, and waveform viewing)
make compile # Compiles the design files into a simulation executable
make sim     # Runs the simulation and generates waveform data
make wave    # Opens the waveform viewer to visualize simulation results
make clean   # Removes all generated files and directories
```
