# Carry Look Ahead Adder

This projects models circuits using CMOS transmission gates.

### What are Transmission Gates?

a CMOS Transmission Gate (TG) is a bidirectional switch made by connecting a PMOS and an NMOS transistor in parallel.  They share source and drain connections, and their gates are driven by complementary control signals (Control signal and its inverse).

ON State (Control HIGH): Both NMOS and PMOS are ON, providing a low-resistance path for signals to flow in either direction. It efficiently passes both logic '0' and logic '1'.
OFF State (Control LOW): Both NMOS and PMOS are OFF, creating a high-resistance path, effectively blocking signal flow.
NMOS and PMOS Transistors as Switches (Simple Switches)

You can also use a single NMOS transistor or a single PMOS transistor as a switch.

NMOS Switch:

Use the NMOS transistor with its drain and source as the switch terminals and the gate as the control.
Turns ON when Gate is HIGH: Conducts when the gate voltage is high relative to the source.
Good at Passing Logic '0': NMOS transistors are excellent at pulling a node down to ground (logic '0'). They pass logic '0' very well with low resistance.
Poor at Passing Logic '1': NMOS transistors are not good at passing logic '1' fully. Due to the threshold voltage (Vt) drop, the output voltage will be approximately VDD - Vt when trying to pass a '1'. This voltage may not be recognized as a full logic '1' by subsequent gates, especially in cascaded stages. This is called threshold voltage drop or level degradation for logic '1'.
Unidirectional (Primarily): While nominally bidirectional in terms of current flow when ON, the control action is gate-to-channel, and source/drain are typically defined.
PMOS Switch:

Use the PMOS transistor with its drain and source as the switch terminals and the gate as the control.
Turns ON when Gate is LOW: Conducts when the gate voltage is low relative to the source.
Good at Passing Logic '1': PMOS transistors are excellent at pulling a node up to VDD (logic '1'). They pass logic '1' very well with low resistance.
Poor at Passing Logic '0': PMOS transistors are not good at passing logic '0' fully. Due to the threshold voltage drop, the output voltage will be approximately Vt (above ground) when trying to pass a '0'. This voltage may not be recognized as a full logic '0'. This is threshold voltage drop or level degradation for logic '0'.
Unidirectional (Primarily): Similar to NMOS, control is gate-to-channel.

## Tools Used

1. Icarus Verilog
    Icarus Verilog (often shortened to Icarus) is a popular, open-source, command-line based Verilog simulator. It's a crucial tool in the world of digital hardware design and verification, especially within open-source and educational settings.
    - Compiles your Verilog code to create an internal representation of your design.
    - Simulates the design using an event-driven engine, processing events (signal changes) in time order.
    - Propagates value changes through the circuit's interconnections.
    - Executes procedural blocks and system tasks.
    - Allows external tools like Cocotb to interact with the simulation through interfaces, enabling powerful verification capabilities.

4. GTKWave
    GTKWave is a powerful waveform viewer used extensively in digital design and electronic design automation (EDA). It's primarily used to visualize signal waveforms generated during simulations of digital circuits and systems described in Hardware Description Languages (HDLs) like Verilog and VHDL.

    - Waveform Viewer: GTKWave's primary purpose is to display and analyze signal waveforms. These waveforms represent how signal values (logic levels, analog voltages, etc.) change over time during a simulation.
    - Post-Simulation Analysis Tool: GTKWave is a post-simulation tool. This means it doesn't perform the simulation itself. Instead, it reads waveform data that has been generated by an HDL simulator (like Icarus Verilog, ModelSim, Vivado Simulator, etc.) after a simulation run is complete.
    - Open Source and Free: GTKWave is open-source software, licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). This makes it freely available to use and distribute, a significant advantage for many users, especially in open-source and educational environments.
    - Cross-Platform: GTKWave is designed to be cross-platform and runs on various operating systems, including Linux, macOS, and Windows. This portability is essential for users working on different development platforms.
    - Graphical User Interface (GUI): GTKWave has a graphical user interface, allowing users to interact with waveforms visually.


## Build Process

```bash
make all     # Performs the entire process (compilation, simulation, and waveform viewing)
make compile # Compiles the design files into a simulation executable
make sim     # Runs the simulation and generates waveform data
make wave    # Opens the waveform viewer to visualize simulation results
make clean   # Removes all generated files and directories
```
