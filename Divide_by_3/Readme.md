# RTL design of an FSM that outputs the reminder of an MSB first input stream when divided by 3.

This project designs an FSM in Verilog that will essentially generate as output the reminder of a serial bit stream inputted MSB first when divided by 3.


## Modeling the Design

To design the state machine , we first try to find a pattern in the generation of remainder when a random serial stream is inputted to the DUT MSB first.

The possible outcomes can be visualized as Shown:

From the above diagram we see that a current input bit can only have 2 possible outcomes, and based on reminder generated by this bit, the next bit reminder can be estimated based on the following pattern:

For current bit's reminder = 0:
if next bit is 1, next reminder 1
if next bit is 0, next reminder 0

For current bit's reminder = 1:
if next bit is 1, next reminder 0
if next bit is 0, next reminder 2

For current bit's reminder = 2:
if next bit is 1, next reminder 2
if next bit is 0, next reminder 1


Based on this logic a state machine can be created as follows:

## Project Organization

This project is organized as follows:

* **build/:** Contains compiled output files.
* **figures/:** Stores generated figures or images.
* **rtl/:** Holds the Register Transfer Level (RTL) Verilog source code files for the CMOS gates.
    * **mux_2x1.v:** Verilog module for a 2x1 MUX.
    * **inverter.v:** Verilog module for an inverter gate.
    * **testbench.sv:** SystemVerilog testbench for verifying the functionality of the designs.
    * **timescale.v:** Verilog file defining the timescale used for simulation.

* **waves/:** Stores waveform data files.
* **Makefile:** File used to automate the build and simulation process.
* **Readme.md:** Documentation file.



## Tools Used

1. Icarus Verilog
    Icarus Verilog (often shortened to Icarus) is a popular, open-source, command-line based Verilog simulator. It's a crucial tool in the world of digital hardware design and verification, especially within open-source and educational settings.
    - Compiles your Verilog code to create an internal representation of your design.
    - Simulates the design using an event-driven engine, processing events (signal changes) in time order.
    - Propagates value changes through the circuit's interconnections.
    - Executes procedural blocks and system tasks.
    - Allows external tools like Cocotb to interact with the simulation through interfaces, enabling powerful verification capabilities.

4. GTKWave
    GTKWave is a powerful waveform viewer used extensively in digital design and electronic design automation (EDA). It's primarily used to visualize signal waveforms generated during simulations of digital circuits and systems described in Hardware Description Languages (HDLs) like Verilog and VHDL.

    - Waveform Viewer: GTKWave's primary purpose is to display and analyze signal waveforms. These waveforms represent how signal values (logic levels, analog voltages, etc.) change over time during a simulation.
    - Post-Simulation Analysis Tool: GTKWave is a post-simulation tool. This means it doesn't perform the simulation itself. Instead, it reads waveform data that has been generated by an HDL simulator (like Icarus Verilog, ModelSim, Vivado Simulator, etc.) after a simulation run is complete.
    - Open Source and Free: GTKWave is open-source software, licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). This makes it freely available to use and distribute, a significant advantage for many users, especially in open-source and educational environments.
    - Cross-Platform: GTKWave is designed to be cross-platform and runs on various operating systems, including Linux, macOS, and Windows. This portability is essential for users working on different development platforms.
    - Graphical User Interface (GUI): GTKWave has a graphical user interface, allowing users to interact with waveforms visually.


## Build Process

```bash
make all     # Performs the entire process (compilation, simulation, and waveform viewing)
make compile # Compiles the design files into a simulation executable
make sim     # Runs the simulation and generates waveform data
make wave    # Opens the waveform viewer to visualize simulation results
make clean   # Removes all generated files and directories
```
